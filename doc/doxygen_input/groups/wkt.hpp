\defgroup wkt wkt: parse and stream WKT (Well-Known Text)
The wkt classes stream the specified geometry as \ref OGC Well Known Text (\ref WKT). It is defined for OGC geometries.
It is therefore not defined for all geometries (e.g. not for circle)
\note The implementation is independant from point type, point_xy and point_ll are supported,
as well as points with more than two coordinates.
