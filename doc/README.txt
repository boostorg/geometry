Introduction

The Generic Geometry Library (currently in "preview 4") provides a generic
implementation of geometry algorithms, working with user-defined geometries.

The algorithms include some well-known and often needed algorithms as
point-in-polygon, polygon area, point-to-point distance, point-to-line
distance, line clipping and polygon clipping, convex hulls. It also contains
transformation algorithms, map projections and selection algorithms.

Besides algorithms the library provides geometry classes which might be used,
but the generic algorithms do not depend on them.

The library follows existing conventions:

 * conventions from boost
 * conventions from the std library
 * OGC names and conventions (see the page about OGC)

This Generic Geometry Library (ggl) is aimed to be proposed to the Boost
Library Collection.

The library can be downloaded from the Boost Sandbox or as a zipfile,
go to the Download page for more information:
