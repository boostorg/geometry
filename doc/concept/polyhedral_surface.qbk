[section:concept_polyhedral_surface PolyhedralSurface Concept]

[heading Description]
[concept PolyhedralSurface..polyhedral surface]

['A PolyhedralSurface is a contiguous collection of polygons, which share common boundary segments] (__ogc_sf__).

[heading Concept Definition]

The PolyhedralSurface Concept is defined as following:

* There must be a specialization of the metafunction `traits::tag`, defining `polyhedral_surface_tag` as type
* It must behave like a Boost.Range Random Access Range
* The type defined by the metafunction `range_value<...>::type` must fulfill
    the [link geometry.reference.concepts.concept_polygon Polygon Concept]

[heading Rules]

Besides the Concepts, which are checks on compile-time, there are
rules that valid PolyhedralSurfaces must fulfill. See the
[link geometry.reference.concepts.concept_polygon Polygon Concept] for more information
on the rules a polygon (and also a polyhedral surface) must fulfill.

Additionally:

* It is a contiguous collection of polygons, which share common boundary segments.
* For any two polygons that share a common boundary, the “top” of the polygon shall be consistent.
    This means that when two LinearRings from these two Polygons traverse the common boundary segment,
    they do so in opposite directions.
