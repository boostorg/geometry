/*!
\defgroup utility utility: utility meta-functions and functions
\details The utilities, mostly in folder util, contain several headerfiles
not fitting in one of the other folders.

The following meta-functions are general and do not relate to GGL:
- add_const_if_c
- select_most_precise

They might fit into boost as a separate trait or utility, or there might
be a Boost equivalent which is yet unnoticed by the authors.
