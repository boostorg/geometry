\defgroup length length: calculate length of a linear geometry
The length algorithm is implemented for the linestring and the multi_linestring
geometry and results in the length of the linestring. If the points of
a linestring have coordinates expressed in kilometers,
the length of the line is expressed in kilometers as well.
\par Example:
Example showing length calculation
\dontinclude doxygen_1.cpp
\skip example_length_linestring_iterators1
\line {
\until }
