To generate it, simulate as if it is already in Boost.Trunk, 
by adding boostbook.dtd and html/callouts/etc,

So folder structure should be like

.../boost/sandbox/geometry/boost [normal]
.../boost/sandbox/geometry/libs [normal]
.../boost/sandbox/geometry/other [normal]
.../boost/sandbox/geometry/libs/doc/html/images/*  [copy files from boost trunk]
.../boost/sandbox/geometry/libs/doc/html/images/callouts/* [copy files from boost trunk]
.../boost/sandbox/geometry/tools/boostbook/dtd/boostbook.dtd [copy file from boost trunk]
