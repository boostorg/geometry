[section:transform_2 transform]

Transforms from one geometry to another geometry using a strategy. 

[heading Synopsis]
``template<typename Geometry1, typename Geometry2>
bool transform (Geometry1 const &geometry1, Geometry2 &geometry2)``

[heading Parameters]

[table
[[Type] [Concept] [Name] [Description] ]
[[Geometry1 const &] [Any type fulfilling a Geometry Concept ] [geometry1] [A model of the specified concept ]]
[[Geometry2 &] [Any type fulfilling a Geometry Concept ] [geometry2] [A model of the specified concept ]]
]


[heading Returns]
true if the transformation could be done
