[section:area_2_with_strategy area (with strategy)]

Calculates the area of a geometry using the specified strategy. 

[heading Description]
The free function area calculates the area of a geometry using the specified strategy. Reasons to specify a strategy include: use another coordinate system for calculations; construct the strategy beforehand (e.g. with the radius of the Earth); select a strategy when there are more than one available for a calculation (e.g. distance over the Earth)

[section:area_1 area]

Calculates the area of a geometry. 

[heading Description]
The free function area calculates the area of a geometry. It uses the default strategy, based on the coordinate system of the geometry.

The area algorithm calculates the surface area of all geometries having a surface, namely box, polygon, ring, multipolygon. The units are the square of the units used for the points defining the surface. If subject geometry is defined in meters, then area is calculated in square meters.

The area calculation can be done in all three common coordinate systems, Cartesian, Spherical and Geographic as well.
