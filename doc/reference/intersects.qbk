[section:intersects_2_two_geometries intersects (two geometries)]

Checks if two geometries have at least one intersection. 

[heading Synopsis]
``template<typename Geometry1, typename Geometry2>
bool intersects (Geometry1 const &geometry1, Geometry2 const &geometry2)``

[heading Parameters]

[table
[[Type] [Concept] [Name] [Description] ]
[[Geometry1 const &] [Any type fulfilling a Geometry Concept ] [geometry1] [A model of the specified concept ]]
[[Geometry2 const &] [Any type fulfilling a Geometry Concept ] [geometry2] [A model of the specified concept ]]
]


[heading Returns]
Returns true if two geometries intersect each other

[heading Header]
Either

`#include <boost/geometry/geometry.hpp>`

Or

`#include <boost/geometry/algorithms/intersects.hpp>`

[include ref/algorithms/intersects.qbk]

[endsect]

[section:intersects_1_one_geometry intersects (one geometry)]

Checks if a geometry has at least one intersection (crossing or self-tangency).

[heading Parameters]

[table
[[Type] [Concept] [Name] [Description] ]

]


[heading Returns]
Returns true if the geometry is self-intersecting
