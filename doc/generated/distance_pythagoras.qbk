Strategy to calculate the distance between two points.

``template<typename Point1, typename Point2, typename CalculationType>
class strategy::distance::pythagoras
{
  // ...
};
``

[[Parameter] [Default] [Description]]
[[typename Point1] [] [point type ]]
[[typename Point2] [Point1] [second point type ]]
[[typename CalculationType] [void] [numeric type for calculation (e.g. high precision); if [*void] then it is extracted automatically from the coordinate type and (if necessary) promoted to floating point]]
