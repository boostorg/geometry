[section:length_2_with_strategy length (with strategy)]

Calculates the length of a geometry using the specified strategy. 

[heading Description]
The free function length calculates the length (the sum of distances between consecutive points) of a geometry using the specified strategy. Reasons to specify a strategy include: use another coordinate system for calculations; construct the strategy beforehand (e.g. with the radius of the Earth); select a strategy when there are more than one available for a calculation. 

[heading Synopsis]
``template<typename Geometry, typename Strategy>
length_result<Geometry>::type length(Geometry const & geometry, Strategy const & strategy)``

[heading Parameters]

[table
[[Type] [Concept] [Name] [Description] ]
[[Geometry const &] [Any type fulfilling a Geometry Concept ] [geometry] [A model of the specified concept ]]
[[Strategy const &] [Any type fulfilling a distance Strategy Concept ] [strategy] [The strategy which will be used for distance calculations ]]
]


[heading Returns]
The calculated length

[heading Header]
Either

`#include <boost/geometry/geometry.hpp>`

Or

`#include <boost/geometry/algorithms/length.hpp>`

[section:length_1 length]

Calculates the length of a geometry. 

[heading Description]
The free function length calculates the length (the sum of distances between consecutive points) of a geometry. It uses the default strategy, based on the coordinate system of the geometry. 

[heading Synopsis]
``template<typename Geometry>
length_result<Geometry>::type length(Geometry const & geometry)``

[heading Parameters]

[table
[[Type] [Concept] [Name] [Description] ]
[[Geometry const &] [Any type fulfilling a Geometry Concept ] [geometry] [A model of the specified concept ]]
]


[heading Returns]
The calculated length

[heading Header]
Either

`#include <boost/geometry/geometry.hpp>`

Or

`#include <boost/geometry/algorithms/length.hpp>`

[include reference/algorithms/length.qbk]
